# Dynamic-web assignment 01
# Architecture design showcase
I like the capybaras and their behaviors.

Create static website
* Show the arrchitectural showcase
* [Ref] (https://www.memedroid.com/memes/tag/capybara)

# Set up and run your application  
* [ Glitch Live site ](https://dw-capybara2.glitch.me/)
* [ Glitch code ] (https://glitch.com/edit/#!/dw-capybara2)

# HTML page
* I used Glitch. The body contains all the content visible to the user.
I used div elements to define containers for various parts of the layout, such as a wrapper for centering the content and an image-container to hold the images.


# Deployment
1. I used my Glitch account and created new project. 
2. Clicked share to Live site
   
## What's in this project?

← `README.md`: That's this file, where you can tell people what your cool website does and how you built it.

← `index.html`: This is the main web page for your site. The HTML defines the structure and content of the page using _elements_. You'll see references in the HTML to the JS and CSS files. Try clicking the image in the center of the page!

← `style.css`: CSS files add styling rules to your content. The CSS applies styles to the elements in your HTML page. The style rules also make the image move when you click it.

← `script.js`: If you're feeling fancy you can add interactivity to your site with JavaScript. The code in the JavaScript file runs when the page loads, and when the visitor clicks the button you can add using the code in the TODO.

Open each file and check out the comments (in gray) for more info.
